HMR_8423	1-alkyldihydroxyacetone-phosphate is the same as alkyl-glycerone-3-phosphate, so it will be replaced with the latter. After replacement, this reaction is imbalanced and does not make sense, so it should be DELETED.
HMR_8301	reaction is imbalanced and the process is captured in other reactions properly, so this reaction should be DELETED.
HMR_8274	reaction treats mass of glycolipid differently than other reactions, and should therefore be DELETED.
HMR_7255	reaction is invalid and associated KEGG ID has been deprecated
