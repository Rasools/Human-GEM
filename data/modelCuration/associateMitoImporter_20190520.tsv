# As proposed in #109 by Avlant Nilsson, new genes are associated with two# mitochondrial amino acid transport reactions. The curation info is organized# into 6 columns: the 3rd column 'grRulesNew' has intended changes to be applied.# The 4th 'Reference' column contains the citations supporting the proopsed# changes, the 5th is desired confidence score, the 6th 'Notes' column gives# additional explaination.rxnID	grRulesOrig	grRulesNew	Reference	confidenceScore	NotesHMR_5113		ENSG00000164466	PMID:30442778	2	Mitochondrial transporter supported by physiological dataHMR_5114		ENSG00000164466 or ENSG00000107819	PMID:30442778	4	Newly identified mitochondrial transporter
